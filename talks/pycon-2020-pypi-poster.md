# Detailed description

## Why this talk

<!-- Optional, depends on the proposal -->

After seeing Brett Cannon's tweets about PyPI keyword stats (for example https://twitter.com/brettsky/status/1200586334261235712) I was inspired to compute my own stats using PyPI's simple API. I found this API accessible even for a beginner Python developer like me, so I wanted to share fun trivia about PyPI.
