## Talk outline

<!-- Include time breakdown if any -->

Duration: 20 minutes
Intro + conclusion: 4 minutes
Each tip: 4 minutes

- drive your career:

  - don't wait for people to notice you, make yourself noticed (fires everywhere)
  - ask for things (promotion, assignment)
  - meet with your manager regularly, and come with a plan (so you can ask for things)

- embrace mistakes (or at least be ok with making some)

  - opportunities to learn
  - growth mindset
  - what's the worst that could happen

- resilience

  - baby steps
  - we learn by being outside our comfort zone
  - increased stress and pressure: doesn't have to be 24/7

- reflect
  - when things don't go our way, look at how far you are compared at before
  - be grateful (reinforced positivity, the more you say sorry, the more you are likely to feel guilty when there‚Äôs no need for that)
  - helps plan what things you wanna ask for: have goals but be flexible
  - keeps you accountable
  - what you're proud of, what you can improve on: Feel proud of where you are now (even if your parents still don‚Äôt understand your job title) and look forward to where you will be going in the future.
