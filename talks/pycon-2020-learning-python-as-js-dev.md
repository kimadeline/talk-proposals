# Abstract

**Length limit:** N/A

What do the Marine Corps, Bear Grylls and a beginner Python developer have in common? They all encounter and move past obstacles throughout their journey. When it comes to Pythonistas like you and me, being able to improvise, adapt and overcome is a key mindset when working to improve our Python skills.

In this talk we will look at some ways we can apply this mindset of adaptation to our Python journey from a JavaScript perspective.

## Audience

<!-- Optional, depends on the proposal -->

This talk is for novice Pythonistas looking to pick up habits to improve their knowledge of Python, developers interested in the perspectives of a fellow polyglot, and folks who'd listen to a behind-the-scenes look on an open-source project.

After this talk, the audience should walk away with some resources to support their Python journey, a few idioms to structure their code in a more Pythonic way, but also be reminded to be kind to open-source contributors, and finally, that growth mindset is a valuable tool that can be used in many situations.

## Talk outline

<!-- Include time breakdown if any -->

### Intro (3 min)

Who I am and why I am giving this talk
What you will learn

- Perspectives of a JS/TS dev on learning Python
- How you can leverage your existing knowledge to help you learn a new programming language
- Baby steps to start working on that impostor syndrome

Outline

### Improvise (9 min)

#### Gotta start somewhere: Writing Python code like a JavaScript developer but working on it

- Online resources
  - https://wiki.python.org/moin/MovingToPythonFromOtherLanguages
  - Documentation
  - Youtube series, for example freeCodeCamp or Microsoft
- Habits to break
  - 👉 Example #1: function nested in a function in my first pull request
  - 👉 Example #2: semicolons and braces
- Discover cool stuff
  - 👉 Example #3: going through a list with and without list comprehension
  - 👉 Example #4: f-strings in Python are similar to JS template strings

#### Learn along with others

- Having to answer questions from Python users and their setups
  - 👉 Example #5: Variety of GitHub issues and user setups I encounter
  - 👉 Example #6: How many python interpreters (including `conda`) I have on my machine, and how I use `pyenv` to manage all of that

#### Side project

- You don't need to know how to start, simply getting out here and doing something is already a big step
- Find a project at the intersection of some of your areas of interest
- 👉 Example #7: My own side project
- Conclusion: I still write Python code like a JavaScript developer, I need help on what's Pythonic and what's not 🆘

### Adapt (9 min)

#### Code structure: the Zen of Python

- What it is and where to find it
- What I think of it
  - Good guidelines, and good to be reminded of them when I go too far down the rabbit hole
  - 👉 Example #8: Yes there should be one obvious way to do things, but they are not obvious when you are new, my experience with `defaultdict`

#### Think like a Python developer

- First thing that comes to mind: Code structure (modules) and naming conventions (underscores instead of dashes)
  - 👉 Example #9: It's ok to have functions floating around and no classes
- When replying to users, they are frustrated because things don't work (otherwise they wouldn't be opening GitHub issues), but sometimes they don't think like Pythonistas either (beginners, Python as an n-th language, casual users)
  - Reply to them with empathy
  - Remember that I also have feelings, so please be kind, and kind ≠ nice

#### Ask for guidance

- 👉 Example #10: My first pull request in Python got so. many. comments from Python core developers on my team, but that's great, because I get to learn directly from the source

### Overcome (6 min)

#### Setbacks

- We don't use the F-word here (failure)
- We all had to start somewhere
- Take them as opportunities to learn (growth mindset 🌱)
  - Reuse Example #9 (my first pull request in Python)

#### Impostor syndrome

- What's the worst that could happen?
- Fake it till you make it works to a certain extent
  - 👉 Example #11: Learning from users by trying to understand their issues and replying to them

### Wrap-up (3 min)

#### Perspectives

- Python has so many different uses (scripting, CV, machine learning), so many different user levels, and so many different setups (python/conda, python 2.7 bundled with macOS until 10.16)
- Easy to pick up, so many ways to mess up
- It's just a language, it's what you build with it that makes you skilled
- Setbacks and challenges are learning opportunities
- Don't take it for granted, it's humans behind it all

#### Be curious and empathetic

- Assume good intent
- Try to understand why the other person thinks in a certain way
- Write more tests

Any additional equipment you might need, whether or not you’ve given this talk before, etc.
-->

**Talk type:** Regular talk

**Talk duration:** 30 minutes

This is my first time submitting to PyCon US, and, if accepted, would be my first time attending it as well. I have given presentations to small groups, but this would also be my first experience speaking in front of a large audience.

This proposal stems from my own experience as JavaScript/TypeScript developer who recently had to learn Python for work. I didn't have the drive of a hobbyist or the expertise of more established Python developers, so I wanted to share how shifting my mindset helped fuel my learning experience. I still end statements with semicolons sometimes though, but I'm getting better at it.

No specific needs or requests 😊
