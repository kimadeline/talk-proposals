# Abstract

**Length limit:** N/A

Have you ever wondered how many PyPI package names contain the word 'python'? Have you run pip install recently? Do you want to know more about PyPI and pip? If you answered yes to any of these questions, this talk is for you! We will explore lesser known pip commands, take a quick dive into PyPI's simple and JSON APIs, and leverage the packaging module to learn more about wheel tags.

# Detailed description

## Why this talk

<!-- Optional, depends on the proposal -->

Installing packages is often a one-time kind of thing, and then we don't think about it anymore until the next project comes by. This talk is two-fold: it first dives into other capabilities offered by pip, so that people have a more global understanding of this tool; the second half of the talk focuses on PyPI and how you can extract information from it, so it would be a good fit for people interested in web scraping, package-related automation, or simply curious about PyPI.
