Reviews tl;dr:

- More storytelling in the proposal: to show the differences between allies, sponsors etc and why/how to use them
- Why am I giving this presentation, what is _my_ story that would make somebody connect with how my experiencee is relevant to the topic
- Mentioned inspiring growth in other in the abstract, but didn't touch on that in the description
- A bit of overlap in the last 2 subtopics, which could be merged and rephrased along the lines of best practices or how to form a mutually productive relationship, instead of "how do I not mess this up"
