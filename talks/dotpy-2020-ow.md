# Abstract

**Length limit:** N/A

With eSports being broadcast on online streams and regular TV stations, in-game video producers have to balance between making the game accessible to casual viewers, and packing enough action on screen to keep regular players interested.

What they choose to show on screen also define the narratives surrounding the competing teams, building hype around them and setting implicit expectations (for example what character class is shown the most).

In this talk we will define, explore and validate a few hypotheses on what eSports broadcasters think viewers want to see through video analysis of professional Overwatch games.

# Detailed description

## Why this talk

<!-- Optional, depends on the proposal -->

This talk will show that you don't have to be an expert to use computer vision tools. In addition to the technical nature of the talk, it will also (hopefully) spark some critical thinking about what's being shown in the content we ingest, making us reflect on what content producers think we want to see.
